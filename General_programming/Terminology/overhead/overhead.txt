Overhead is a terminology to use when
- There are few differents indirect steps to do to reach the main goal
- The resources needs to operate a task 
    Ex1:To go to a specific destination we can walk or use a car. If we simply go to near location, waking is a good and direct method to choose
        But we can also choose car instead, and the overhead from using a car is not really worthwhile (gas, money to buy car, how to drive, ...)
        In a differents situation, we want to go to a far away land, walking may not be a good option, while we can bare the indirect cost of using car in the scenario
    Ex2:Inline is an example of this terminology, we use inline for small function as it can boost the speed with the small cost of program size increase.
        But when function is too big, Inline will expanse total size way more than it need to.
    => Depend on the situation, we can choose to bare the overhead (or indirect cost) or not.
